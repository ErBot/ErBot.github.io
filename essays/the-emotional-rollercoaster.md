JavaScript feels like someone got frustrated with Java’s strict syntax and decided to give it a “chill pill”. It seems as if they wanted to create a more flexible version of Java for the next generation of programmers. I know that’s not really how it started but that’s the impression that was left on me. Its flexibility allows for a more fluid coding experience. I don’t have enough experience with JavaScript to fully determine its value, but it seems like an efficient programming language. 
 
I originally learned Java by sitting through a two-hour lecture and then applying what we learned by solving a coding problem in a three-hour lab. As a passive learner, I appreciate classes where the instructors actually teach me the toolsets and show me how to use them. I can honestly say it’s the least stressful ICS class I’ve ever taken. The one problem was that if I spaced out, even for a minute, I would miss crucial information and struggle during the lab. In ICS 314, we get a similar level of clarity with the added benefit of being able to freely space out and rewind. The practice WODs, when performed as intended, make the in-class WODs fairly easy. The fact that we are timed is a bit stressful, especially if we have unreliable computers, but the WODs aren’t all that hard. Completing multiple assignments each week is probably the most stressful part of this class.

I tried to teach myself JavaScript and React over the summer, but I found that reading a book and watching outdated YouTube tutorials killed all motivation. I can honestly that I’m learning more efficiently in ICS 314 and enjoying the class at the same time. I’m hoping this class will give me all the tools I need to finish up all my side projects. It’s a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, in terms of stress levels, but it is manageable.
