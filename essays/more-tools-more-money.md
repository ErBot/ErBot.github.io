Web development frameworks are packages of code that help reduce the amount of overhead when creating new web applications. In our course, we used a combination of Semantic UI in React, with API’s such as Google Maps and Leaflet. The benefit of using these frameworks was to automate the majority of CSS and HTML code associated with our JavaScript code. By using Semantic UI, we were able to condense multiple lines of code to only a couple. For example, instead of having to write code for a submit button, link that button to a form’s data, and then pass that data to a method to process the data, we were able to condense all that code to a <SubmitField>  tag. This tag automatically created the button and gathered the data to be passed to a submit function. Another important benefit of using frameworks is having a way to create apps that function properly across multiple platforms. By creating a reactive application, we can ensure that our application will function when viewed on a phone, laptop, or tablet. 

Another useful skillset we picked up in ICS 314 was the ability to quickly manage projects to meet the requirements at hand. Whether it was quickly changing an existing website mockup to fit the demands of our daily web development exercises or providing a way to handle multiple users submitting code, Agile Project Management was crucial to the success of our projects. We were able to use GitHub, a project management platform, to store new web projects and then quickly branch off those existing projects to create new websites that had similar characteristics. When working in group projects we were able to create a Master Branch that held our working prototype. Then, every time we created a new feature, we would branch off Master to make sure we didn’t break the working code. Once the feature was complete and operational, we could merge the branch back into Master so that everyone else had access. By splitting features amongst our group, we were all able to simultaneously create new features while having access to the active Master Branch. Though merging conflicts would occasionally arise, having the ability to update our local branches from Master gave us the opportunity to integrate the recent changes to Master and deconflict our merging process.

Frameworks have become the standard for modern web application development, and I foresee myself using React in the future. Part of the reason why I opted to take ICS 314 was to learn how to use React and gain experience working in teams with GitHub. The summer prior to taking this class, I was passed up to work on a collaborative project because the only User Interface experience I had was an outdated framework called JavaFX. In fact, the day after I submitted my working prototype for judging, JavaFX was officially an unsupported platform and the new update completely broke my application. The people trying to hire me wanted my efficient engineering perspective but did not bring me onboard because they wanted someone that knew how to use GitHub, and had experience developing modern web applications with React. With both toolsets in my toolbelt, I can now confidently apply to a whole new category of internships.
