<h2>Good question...</h2>

I'm trying to make a function that will compare multiple variables to an integer and output a string of three letters. I was wondering if there was a way to translate this into Python. So say:

x = 0
y = 1
z = 3
mylist = []

if x or y or z == 0 :
    mylist.append("c")
if x or y or z == 1 :
    mylist.append("d")
if x or y or z == 2 :
    mylist.append("e")
if x or y or z == 3 : 
    mylist.append("f")
which would return a list of

["c", "d", "f"]
Is something like this possible?

In depth answer leading an indepth description of "or" and "==" usage and operator precedence. 


<h2>Bad question..</h2>

I have a folder with the files a.txt, b.txt, and c.txt in it. and I want to use a for-loop to get the names of these files, store them in a variable, and then add them to another text file. The text files are located in the same file as my bat file. Is it possible to do this? If so please show me, these for loops confuse the crap out of me...

What i have now

  @echo on

  SET name=hey
  echo >text.txt

  for %F in (*.*) do (set name=@fname
  echo name >> text.txt)
