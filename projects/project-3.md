summary: Create a web application for users to find study spots around UH Manoa.
---

Our final software engineering project for ICS 314 was a web application that students of the University of Hawaii at Manoa can use to find local places to do their studying. Similar to yelp, it shows all the currently listed locations on a map and shows their ratings based on user submitted reviews. Users can use the application without logging in, but must create an account in order to submit reviews. We're hoping that this application can be a benefit to those who don't venture out to find other spots around campus. The full description of our project can be found in the website below.
