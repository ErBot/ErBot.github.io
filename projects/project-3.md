<h1>Abstract</h1>
Our final software engineering project for ICS 314 was to develop a prototype web application where students of the University of Hawaii at Manoa can find local places to study. Similar to yelp, it shows all the currently listed locations on a map and shows their ratings based on user submitted reviews. Users can use the application without logging in, but must create an account in order to submit reviews. We're hoping that this application can be a benefit to those who haven't ventured out to find other spots around campus. The full description of our project's architecture can be found in the project's development website linked below. The deployed prototype page can be found <a href="http://studiousmanoa.meteorapp.com/#/">here</a>. This project was developed using Semantic UI in React for the user interface, MongoDB for backend databases, and Meteor for deployment.
